##The Basics

I'm a fullstack developer who likes to work mostly in Python. My main interests are related to machine learning, but I've worked on embedded, application and web development projects quite extensively as well. I'm especially excited to talk about probabalistic models, Bayesian methods, and unsupervised and supervised learning of highly structured semantic formats (ie: natural langauge).

I made this blog to allow me to write about programming, machine learning and document my projects. I think a lot of math and programming, particularily the parts concerning probability, is often taught quite poorly - I strive to be able to fully explain the intiution behind everything I use, and hope to do some of that here.

I have a pretty broad range of interests - in university I was heavily involved in competititive debate, and before that my main time sink was competitive robotics. In my last job I designed, repaired and improved e-commerce websites for a large variety of clients, both big and small and even built a few stores of my own. The next challenge for me is to use machine learning and statistics to help solve some hard problems.
